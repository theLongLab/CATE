# CATE (CUDA Accelerated Testing of Evolution)

A fast and scalable CUDA implementation to conduct highly parallelized evolutionary tests on large-scale genomic data.

---
#### Description

The CATE software is a CUDA based solution to enable rapid processing of large-scale VCF files to conduct a series of six different tests on evolution.

ðŸ”µ **Here we have provided only a brief overview of CATE's useability.**   
ðŸŸ¢ **Please refer to [CATE's wiki](https://github.com/theLongLab/CATE/wiki) to obtain a more detailed understanding of its functionality and usability.**

---

#### News

ðŸ”´ **CATE is currently under a major update with the integration of APOLLO.**

*Apollo is our high-performance viral epidemic simulation platform powered by CATE's architecture.*

Apollo is already available in CATE for use. Use the **--simulator** or **-sim** command. Documentation and a preprint of the simulation tool, its capabilities, and how to use Apollo are currently being worked on.

The Wiki for Apollo is currently being written and will be completed soon.

#### Prerequisites

1. CUDA capable hardware
2. LINUX or UNIX based kernel
3. NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit (nvcc compiler)
4. C++ compiler (gcc compiler)

#### How to INSTALL

![C/C++ CUDA CI](https://github.com/theLongLab/CATE/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

CATE can be used **on-device** via **Ananconda** or by downloading and building the **GitHub** repo. It can also be used **online** via **Google Colab**.

For the **Google Colab** notebook please follow the link to [CATE on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p8I2umE1U2gEB95eKwg0-fdtOLbgR13-?usp=sharing).

To install CATE via [**Anaconda**](https://anaconda.org/deshan_CATE/cate):

[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/deshan_cate/cate/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/deshan_cate/cate)
[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/deshan_cate/cate/badges/latest_release_date.svg)](https://anaconda.org/deshan_cate/cate)
[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/deshan_cate/cate/badges/platforms.svg)](https://anaconda.org/deshan_cate/cate)

````
conda install deshan_cate::cate
````
To ensure successful installation run the following:
````
CATE -h
````
Else, if you want to install CATE **on-device** using the GitHub repo you might have to compile the code using an nvcc compiler. If so execute the following on the terminal:

Download the repository:
````
git clone "https://github.com/theLongLab/CATE/"
````
````
cd CATE/
````
*cuda 11.3.0 or higher*
````
module load cuda/11.3.0
````

Finally, compile the project:
````
nvcc -std=c++17 *.cu *.cpp -o "CATE"
````
To ensure successful installation try running:
````
CATE -h
````

#### How to RUN

CATE is a command-line-based software. Its available functions include six different tests on evolution and a series of tools for editing and processing FASTA and VCF files.

The six tests on evolution are:
1. Tajimaâ€™s D
2. Fu and Li's D, D*, F, and F \*
3. Fay and Wuâ€™s H and E
4. McDonaldâ€“Kreitman test
5. Fixation Index
6. Extended Haplotype Homozygosity

CATE comes equipped with Apollo, our viral simulator that spans from network level to individual virion resolution complete with within-host dynamics. Apollo comes with its main simulation function and five additional utility tools.

1. _Apollo simulator_
2. Haplotype retriever
3. Pedigree retriever
4. Segregating sites matcher
5. Base substitution model to JSON
6. Recombination hotspots to JSON

---

Currently, the program's executable is called:  
>Test_Main

To run the software you need a JSON-style parameters file. An example is provided above:

> *parameters.json*.

*The parameters file is used to specify all input and output locations as well as the gene list file locations. Each function's execution can be customized individually using the parameters file.*

The typical syntax for program __execution__ is as follows (example below shows running the Tajima's function):
> program_executable --function parameter_file

> program_executable -f parameter_file

__Example:__

>./Test_Main -t parameters.json

The __HELP__ menu will list all available functions and how each function can be executed. It can be accessed by simply typing -h as the function as shown below:

> ./Test_Main -h
